## Description

This bright orange gatling gun was one of the first models I made while becoming more familar with 3D modeling and [Cinema 4D](https://www.maxon.net/en-us/products/cinema-4d/overview/). Due to it's simplistic nature, I decided it would be fitting to give it a more vibrant, cartoonish style.
