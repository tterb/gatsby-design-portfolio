## Description

**Hyde** is an [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)-based markdown editor that aims to improve the accessibility of creating beautifully formatted markdown documents for developers and non-developers, alike. This goal is achieved through an approachable modular interface, capable of offering the same familiar toolbars and live-preview that you would find in a word-processor or the simplicity and streamlined workflow of a minimalistic text editor.  
Additionally, while Hyde was initially created to cater to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) users, during development the oppurtunity was recognized to similarly improve the writing experience across various platforms. Therefore, additional features have been integrated that allow Hyde to cater to the wide variety of popular platforms and tools that utilize markdown formatting.
