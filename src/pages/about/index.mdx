 Hi, my name is Brett and I'm a full-stack software developer with a passion for exploring all avenues of creativity and design. While my primary focus as a designer is Web and User-Interface design, as it relates most to my role as a developer, I also enjoy expanding my illustration and 3D modeling capabilities.
